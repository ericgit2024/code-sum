Training --> GemmaModel : "Downloads &\nfine-tunes"
Training --> Dataset : "Loads training\ndata"

Inference --> GemmaModel : "Uses fine-tuned\nmodel"

note right of System
  **Core Capabilities:**
  • Fine-tune Gemma 2B with LoRA
  • Extract code structures (AST/CFG/PDG)
  • Generate natural language summaries
  • Iterative refinement with reflective agent
  • Evaluate with BLEU/ROUGE/METEOR
